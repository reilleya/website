        .description I'm a software engineer with interests in aerospace, 3D printing, and electronics. I love projects that span multiple of these passions and set up this website to document my explorations into them. I studied EECS (6-2) at MIT and was active on the MIT Rocket Team. Before that I attended the Maine School of Science and Math, where I learned how to tolerate cold weather. I currently write software for 3D printers at Markforged.
