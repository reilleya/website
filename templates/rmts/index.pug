        .description RMTS is a complete set of test stand electronics in a single board designed for amateur motor builders. The system features a long-range radio that allows an operator to fire their motor from a safe distance, complete with continuity monitoring. The system includes transducers that collect pressure and thrust data to validate simulations and understand motor performance. RMTS gives the amateur rocketry community an integrated and safe way to operate and evaluate their motors on a test stand.

        .description This project is entirely open source, which means anyone can build their own RMTS based on the code and board layouts hosted on github. Links to relevant repositories are below. I do plan to offer assembled systems for sale soon for those who want a turnkey solution.
